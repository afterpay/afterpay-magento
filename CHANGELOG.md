Community & Enterprise Edition enhancements

Security
-	To verify the integrity of each transaction, an additional API call has been implemented.
-	This call verifies the transaction integrity by comparing the original value at time of checkout against the value present prior to payment capture, of the following:
		- 	Afterpay token ID
		- 	Magento Quote reserved order ID
		- 	Magento Quote total amount
-	In the instance of a discrepancy between these values, the transaction is cancelled and no payment capture attempts will be made. 

Checkout support
- 	A default handling has been introduced to accommodate checkout extensions that sit outside of the supported list.
- 	The handling also reduces instances of JS conflict between Afterpay plugin and site-specific customization.
- 	The current supported checkout list includes the below, and remains unchanged from previous release:
		- 	Magento Native Checkout
		- 	OneStepCheckout by OneStepCheckout
		- 	One Step Checkout by Magestore
		- 	One Step Checkout by Aheadworks
		- 	LightCheckout by GoMage
		- 	FireCheckout by Template Masters
 
Product-level Configuration enhancements
- 	Merchant’s Afterpay transaction limits are now applied at the Product-level as well as at the Checkout-level.
- 	Magento Admin Afterpay plugin Enabled / Disabled dropdown now removes Product-level assets when set to ‘Disabled’.
 
Miscellaneous
- 	Plugin version number convention now aligns for Composer support.
- 	Validation of merchant credentials (Merchant ID and Merchant Key) extended to exclude non-alphanumeric characters.
- 	Installation process improvement to allow Magento to handle install error.
 
Enterprise Edition only enhancements
 
Magento Store credit support
- 	Afterpay plugin now supports transactions that utilise Magento’s native store credit functionality.
- 	Plugin supports detection and deduction Magento store credit when used in conjunction with the Afterpay payment method.
- 	A transaction decline or cancellation during the Afterpay payment process will not result in a store credit deduction.
- 	Optional refund support for return of store credit from Magento Admin.



### 0.13.1 - 2016-11-17
[1] Added support for user identification - Guest and Registering users.
Plugin now populates the following flags:
·         sales_flat_quote.customer_is_guest
·         sales_flat_order.customer_is_guest
·         customer_entity.group_id (e.g. link Guest to NOT_LOGGED_IN)
·         sales_flat_quote.customer_group_id
·         sales_flat_order.customer_group_id


[2] Additional handling has been added so that the Afterpay plugin explicitly sets the ‘customer_is_guest’ flag (to 0 or 1) for all quote-to-order conversion scenarios.  
This is an overriding measure should the flag be set to an incorrect state by another actor.


[3] Revised error message handling for the scenario when a user attempts to register with Afterpay using an email address that already exists on Magento. 
Magento message now displayed in this scenario:
“There was an error processing your order. There is already a customer registered using this email address. Please login using this email address or enter a different email address to register your account."
 
 
[4] Added support for Registering users with OneStepCheckout shopping cart extension.
https://www.onestepcheckout.com
Enhancements to allow user creation in Magento for Registering users in transaction with OneStepCheckout.


[5] Added support for Magento new batch confirmation email sending
Prior to Magento version Community 1.9.1 and Enterprise 1.14.1, emails were triggered on transaction completion.
From Magento version Community 1.9.1 and Enterprise 1.14.1 onwards, emails are batched. 
This release includes support for this batched email sending.
